Hi Team Pancake! 

Lets talk about what we want to display in our plots-- what variables to
compare? 
My initial thoughts are plotting
Break down the graphs into different continents and see if there is a 
different rate of increase of gdpPercap vs lifeExp? I guess it can also 
be in the same graph and make it colorful...
